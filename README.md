## Overview

This is a repository for our open source smart home device/remote controller for businesses.

## Business Description

In our increasingly digitizing age, privacy intrusions and data breaches are becoming more common, and we are seeing a large push against that from the consumers. Our product adopts ethical and transparent business strategy that allows us to stand out from competition and appeal to privacy cautious individuals and businesses that value independency and transparency. We open source our software and hardware and instead sell cloud subscription to consumers and maintenance & repair services to businesses. Open nature of our product allows consumers and buisnesses to change cloud provider or even resort to self hosting, and it enables the community to make contrbutions or verify security of our solutions, to make sure that our products can be trusted.
